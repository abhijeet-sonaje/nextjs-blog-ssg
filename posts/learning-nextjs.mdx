# Diving into Next.js

I recently started learning Next.js, and it's been an amazing experience so far. 

Here are some things I've learned:

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  Next.js makes it easy to render pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
* **Static Site Generation (SSG):**  For content that doesn't change frequently, SSG is a great way to generate static HTML files at build time.
* **API Routes:**  Building APIs with Next.js is super convenient.

I'm excited to continue exploring the possibilities of Next.js!
